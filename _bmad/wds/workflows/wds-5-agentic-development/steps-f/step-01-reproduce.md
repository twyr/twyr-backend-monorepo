# Step 1: Reproduce

## STEP GOAL:

Confirm the bug exists and document exact reproduction steps.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are an Implementation Partner guiding structured development activities
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring software development methodology expertise, user brings domain knowledge and codebase familiarity
- ✅ Maintain clear and structured tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on gathering bug report details, setting up reproduction environment, and reproducing the bug
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to begin investigating root cause or implementing fixes — those are later steps
- 💬 Approach: Methodically reproduce the issue with user, documenting every step and observation
- 📋 Bug must be reproduced at least twice before proceeding; if non-reproducible, follow the non-reproducible protocol

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Confirm the bug exists with documented, repeatable reproduction steps
- 💾 Update dialog file with reproduction details, screenshots/logs
- 📖 Reference the bug report or user description
- 🚫 Do not investigate code or attempt fixes during this step

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Bug report or user description of the issue
- Focus: Reproduction — confirming the bug exists and documenting how to trigger it
- Limits: No code investigation, no fix attempts
- Dependencies: A bug report or description must exist

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Gather Bug Report Details

- Read the bug report or user description
- Extract: what happened, what was expected, when it started
- Note the reporter's environment (browser, device, OS, screen size)
- Identify any relevant user actions leading up to the bug

### 2. Set Up Reproduction Environment

- Match the reporter's environment as closely as possible
- Use the same browser, viewport, and device settings
- Ensure you are on the same version/branch of the code
- Load any required test data or user state

### 3. Reproduce the Bug

- Follow the reported steps exactly, in order
- Document each action and its result
- Capture screenshots or logs at each step
- Record the exact error messages, console output, or visual artifacts

### 4. Confirm Reproducibility

- Reproduce at least twice to confirm consistency
- Note if the bug is intermittent (and under what conditions)
- Test slight variations to understand the trigger boundaries

### 5. Handle Non-Reproducible Bugs

If the bug cannot be reproduced:

- Request more details from the reporter (exact steps, screenshots, browser version)
- Check if the bug is environment-specific (browser, OS, network)
- Check if recent changes resolved it inadvertently
- Document what was tried and what remains unknown
- Do NOT proceed to investigation without reproduction or a clear theory

### 6. Verify Checklist

- [ ] Bug report details gathered and understood
- [ ] Reproduction environment matches reporter's setup
- [ ] Bug reproduced at least twice
- [ ] Reproduction steps documented precisely
- [ ] Screenshots/logs captured
- [ ] Dialog file updated with reproduction details

### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Step 2: Investigate"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Update design log, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the bug has been reproduced and documented with exact steps will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Bug report details gathered and understood
- Reproduction environment matches reporter's setup
- Bug reproduced at least twice
- Reproduction steps documented precisely
- Screenshots/logs captured
- Dialog file updated with reproduction details

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Proceeding to investigation without reproducing the bug
- Attempting to fix the bug before understanding how to trigger it
- Not documenting reproduction steps
- Skipping environment setup

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
